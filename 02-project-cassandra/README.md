* Implement an ETL pipeline in python for the Cassandra database that is able to create queries on song and play data.

#### Project Data
* event_data:
    A directory of CSV files partitioned by date that contains songs and user activity.

* Simulated User Event Data
    Simulated activity logs for a music streaming app is generated by eventsim.
    Event data for testing is in JSON format.

### Running Process
From the terminal, navigate to the file working directory and the following python scripts:
* create_tables.py
* etl.py


### Explanation of Project Files
* create_tables.py drops and creates database tables. This file resets tables before ETL scripts are run.
* etl.py reads and processes files from ... and ... and loads them into tables.
* sql_queries.py contains sql queries and is used by create_tables.py and etl.py.
