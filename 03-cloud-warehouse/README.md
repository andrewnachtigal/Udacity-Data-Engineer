## Data Warehouse Setup for Song Play Analysis

Design and implement a database for a fictional music streaming startup, Sparkify in order to move processes and data onto the cloud. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Main Processing Steps

* extracts data from S3
* stages them in Redshift
* transforms data into a set of dimensional tables (star schema) for their analytics team to continue finding insights * in what songs their users are listening to
* run queries for testing, given by the fictional analytics team of Sparkify

## Datasets

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

Both the song datasets and the user log datasets are read in "json" format. The song dataset is a subset of the Million Song Dataset and the log datasets have been created by this event simulator.

## Database Design

The database is designed using a Star Schema: A fact table and dimension tables

**Fact Table**

* songplays

**Dimension Tables**

* users
* songs
* artists
* times
