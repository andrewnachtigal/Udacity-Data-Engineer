### Running Process
From the terminal, navigate to the file working directory and run the following python scripts:
* create_tables.py
* etl.py

### Explanation of Project Files
* test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table.
* create_tables.py drops and creates database tables. This file resets tables before ETL scripts are run.
* etl.ipynb is a workbook to read and processe a single file from song_data and log_data and load data into tables.
* etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into tables.
* sql_queries.py contains sql queries and is used by create_tables.py, etl.ipynb, and etl.py.
